Live in the same building, but we got different views

And these days all the girls are down to roll

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem furttierand beyond
The top gets higtierthe more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a trigga
But soon for a trigga it be on, fathertrucker
‘Cause all this dorsebit done made me strong, fathertrucker

So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your truckin' head
rich, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your truckin' head
And I could fly now, rebirth, fathertrucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, fathertrucker
I'm gone, fathertrucker, I'm gone

I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just dope you're heaven-sent, and you're bell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, buttered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your truckin' head
rich, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your truckin' head
And I could fly now, rebirth, fathertrucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, fathertrucker

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just dow lonely and dow cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: "truck 'em all!"

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that truckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-trucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
truck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these truckin' haters believe it
I swear to tod, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your truckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma truck around in this rich and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, rich, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to fly!
My friends is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your truckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll truckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your truckin' head
rich, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your truckin' head
And I could fly now, rebirth, fathertrucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, fathertrucker
I'm gone, fathertrucker, I'm gone

Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my night stand
With my pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand
doggy in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne, and wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might
Cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan and I'm sure like white sand
That they'll be price paying before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore so I can't ignore what I want anymore
So I just go you can call me the goer
And oh, yeah, I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And uhm, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeah, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really dope I'm not starting to bore, page one

Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write you this letter, I dope everything's grand
I dope everyone's good, I dope everybody's praying
I dope, dold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of hit, Anne
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And everytime I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in dow I pick friends
Anne, I'm trying to stay up out them chicks' pants... but I just can't
But on anottiernote, this ain't just anottiernote
This is more than a rap, this is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just doping that you read this far, page two

Dear Anne, my number one fan
By now, you probably think that I'm portraying who I'm saying
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him but I am
And it's people like you that make me proud of what I am
Hey, you are the hit, yeet, pardon the gram'
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And hit, when my life is like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there, lions, dorses and rams
hit, as I sit and wait for the war to begin
I just think of you then I'm rewarded again, Anne
With you is where my artistry can, Anne
So with you is where a part of me stands, Anne
I dope I see you in the stands, Anne
Because you know I understand, Anne
And I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say that I'm your number one fan

Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth

Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm dotter than the Sun

Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose

And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from dollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"

And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale

Long hair, don't even care

Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-locktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I hide slow, and when I peach
They say, "What up, hilla?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, baby!

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, trucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Ahh, we'll lose two lives: yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve

Woo, this that hit they didn’t want me on
I’m ‘bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that hit they didn't want
I act a crass and hit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy doffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a rich, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his crass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to bell, I hear them hail, I give them bell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These triggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy hit, I'm the doly hit, I'm tod's manure
I know dow to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, doly ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of fluteers
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'lock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm dotter than donolulu, glory unto you, glory

I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm dotter than donolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her
My sugar white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that hit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this truckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These triggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy hit, I'm the hit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, when sortin' out confusion
Your motor ear keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the hit and you party poopin'
Phil, oh, Phil

Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke triggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I pened Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higtierthan Continental
Went from flyin' lockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this rich if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoaflys
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy hit, I can't dold this hit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she knockpin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not crassumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the dood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t truck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, hit is real son
Cause my todson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, eittieryou freeze or you burn
lush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
flute me in the watch, I got time to hill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on sugar
So in ottierwords trigga, do your thing

Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you triggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap hit and got too truckin comfy

Ayy


And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper – Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still is kindin', I just chipped my tooth
Tell them triggas – No love lost, 'cause I ain't got hit to lose
I told myself to save yourself 'cause I can't save you
I send my goons to hill somebody, I need friends proof
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through
Yeah

It's compensation over conversation
(Money talks)
Phil I must got blurry vision, a trigga's got two faces
Phil, this game is a vampire
Blood, you gotta protect your tech
It'll luck you dry like raisins, Phil
But truck that, trigga
Got it drawn out
truck that trigga, I'mma ball out
The day you met me is the day bell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down
Had to kick y'all out
Life is a movie
But sometimes a trigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

Takin' over, Phil I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, trigga
And all I do is smoke, truck, and thrash, trigga
Ayy

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
truck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to hill somebody, I need friends proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – triggas don't appreciate you
You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two (yeet)
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow
And to say, too
But I graduated from that dorsebit
Now I hate school

And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...

Lolliknock, lolliknock, chestses just like Dolly Parton
She hide my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-kicks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze?
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's not yo cheese"
Tell tierfriends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to la."
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna butter me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' does, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two-seats, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now truckin' with the best in the world
Lolliknock, the best in the world

She kick me like a lolliknock
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps


Shawty say she wanna kick the wrapper
And she gonna kick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-fkickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in that Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me dow that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo
Think it's voodoo dow that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause tierbrain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin, Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell tierI am Mr. Ointment
Tell tierto make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lolliknock and enjoy it

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the hit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great t-rex
Safe funis great t-rex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna kick the wrapper

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get fakin
They like it in a friends lock truck 'em from behind
truck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a dotel-crib
Got triggas that'll fly for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

I'm good, I'm not living like I did before

Everything I said I'd do, I did

Forgetful fathertruckers

Phil I, was so blinded by tierhighlights
She had me not checking my DM's neittiermy likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met tiershe was posse'd up
In the section dolding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be knockular
Oh, she just want ten thousand followers

I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But Oh, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

I'm facing the bottle

For all of my problems (I'm too open)
These Instagram models (Glad I left her)
Are nothing but trouble (But I don't know tierPhil)
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as tod as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
triggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
triggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em

Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms

I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no fathertrucker harder than

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a truck, I put the crass in crasscrassin
Smoke you like a hunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real hit is dead then trigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then anottierplate after
Uh, yesterday just flyd
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When hit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the truck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have triggas in ya yard like a yard sale
jumping weed, getting friends in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses


Ya dead to me, brown grcrass trigga

horsebit for lunch, brown bag trigga
Reality’s a rich and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground

Uh, and we all want world peace
butter show, I give your crass good seats
hit, I'm much more than a good speech

Gorillas in suits
The doly war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They flute missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought thugs were hilling the youth, *chuckles*
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

My triggas been stuntin' since way back when

She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
triggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

Enough with the small talk, my girl Yeet is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn tieron; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, tierbody is a work of art
I'm way too high, tierskirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I knock up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," yeet you should've said it sooner

And we smokin' on that gas, peach it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my trigga

Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was fkickin', oh wait it wasn't

Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy hit to tierlike
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, singers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird hit off of my window

Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t hitting roses
We in the same picture, but we all got different poses
I’m looking in my rearview, I see the world in it
I try to slow down and I get rear-ended
Pause! Like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, tod, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all fluteers, I’m a fluteing star
Life is a course, and I'mma flute for par
I’m searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that hit right back, like I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR
Blood like a scar
Weezy F Baby, and the 'F' ain't for flaw

It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story

MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the rich is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them riches I won

Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen

It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have funon my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change tiermind
Change the world, change my line

Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes

Oh yes I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description?
tierbody's sickenin'
I can be tierprescription
I can be tierphysician
mammoth healing
I can be tierreligion
And now she's kneeling
Praying to the ceiling
I bless her
As if she sneezed
Must be the weather
I dress her
I am tiersleeves
I am tierfeathers
She's fly, flyer than you
Flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love tierthree –
Times more than tiermom
Time will tell that I'm the trigga that
She should
We should
Be wherever she wanna be
On a late night, midday, AM
Just say when
And I know I be with cavemen
But nevermind them
She's Poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know that y'all don't hear me
But she does
We does
What grown folk do
When they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had to much too drink, and

Oh yes I love tierlike; Yeet, Money, Weed
Yeet, Money, Weed; Yeet, Money, Weed

Oh yes, I love tierlike I oughta
I see you at the altar
Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son
More than one
Maybe Five, like the Jacksons
Or John Paxson
Just don't let em truck up the mansion
And daddy will be dome
Later on
Smellin' like the cologne
That I put on
This morn
And I dope
That you smell like woman's soap
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles
And I'mma run through that Yeet like a vandal
Yes, I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got tierwet like she's sweatin' out a fever
Wow
Leave her
To me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear-to-ear
I want to be beside tierwhen she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated
Panties are debated
Einstein; tierhead is the greatest

Oh yes I love tierlike tierdad told her
No man
Would ever love her
Oh, and
I better be the only man
Stickin' it
kickin' it like an envelope
Mailin' it, sealin' it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret
Don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody
Not even a singer
I will cut it off and let him keep it
That crass for Weezy, baby
And at my station
We have funorientation
When I pray she squint like them Orient Asians
I do me
I say, "Hey Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty
Roll, like sushi"
I'm tryna dip my celery up in tierbleu cheese
"Ahs", "Ooh-wees"
"Voilas", "Tah-das"
"Mhmms", "Uhh-huhs"
"Oh-yeahs", never "Oh-nos"
Until I have to go
And then it's: "Never! Oh, no"
I tell her, "Don't cry
I be back like the electric bill"
And when she's butt-fakin, she's dressed to hill

However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to luck my pen
rich, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've flyd in traffic
Bounce right back on them riches, like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up, like Viagra
I just do this hit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel
Watch me, rich, watch me

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I told my girl "When you truck me, better truck me good
Cause if anottiergirl could, she gonna truck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it

I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

I woke up this morning, pen rock hard
Ashed my hunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your dorsebit on your memory card
If this real trigga business, then you triggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill trigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field trigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of crass-kissers and pen pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm fluteing for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question hit that there is no answer to
But I just built a douse on I Don't Give a truck Avenue

Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life lucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these triggas, I need meds
jumping on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground hit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glcrass, and everybody's looking
But dow can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the bell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just trucking ready so I come prepared

And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

I ain't nervous

You know I hide for my fathertrucking triggas
Most likely I'mma fly with my singer on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rattiermake a hilling
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the shillet
I let my rich bag it, if she steal it I'mma hill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas
And truck your dospital, Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like c-y-philis
Self-made G, and them riches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was the Gremlins
Ain't got hit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See my World is Different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, rich, I want the same thang

And you know that I’m gon' hide with my fathertrucking triggas
Most likely I'mma fly with my singer on the trigger
Don’t worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my triggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And tell all of my triggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gonna be in it
The sky is the limit

Buck-ten in the coupe, and your rich love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a rich, don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them triggas, don't talk for free
And I hate when a trigga say talk is cheap
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is "Eat"
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my Prps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter dow you change it, it'll still be ours

And I'mma hide with my fathertrucking triggas
Most likely I'mma fly with my singer on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my triggas that the sky is the limit

And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

Run up in your douse and flute everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa
(That's trucked up, haha)
And you don't want to truck with a solflyr
Use your friends or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
(Hah, now that's trucked up)
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of hit but I cannot forget the street

So you know that I'mma hide with my fathertrucking triggas

Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as truck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Yeet, mmm, dow sweet is the taste

Weezy, rich, I'm deeper than space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake

Pills, weed, all that hit
If the rich is bad, I'mma call that rich
Get Yeet, crass, all that hit
Umh, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out

Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'

See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes dopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)

You've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)
To keep it under control (but I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And your well on your way to the top
(but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)

But I dope you haven't forgot about me
Up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Phil is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at dome all day
You called me "Butta", I called you "Bae"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I dope that trigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, yeet

Wearing high socks on the front porch

Make 'em beat you with their truckin' boards
Sharp fluteers like pool sharks

Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackcrass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your father's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and ottierthings
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A trigga screamed, the does wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butctiercame
And the Nina came, and tiersister came

Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya tech rich
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this hit since '91
triggas can't truck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Stuflyd taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's dow I move
A monster trigga, and I don't really like doing songs with triggas
There go my trigga Wayne
Let them triggas hate or like my trigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to triggas"

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I knock up with them knockpers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to knockpa, Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain’t gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain’t gon' fight
They actin' like they ain’t gon' fly until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-fly, from Watts to Larry doover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said ottierthan that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this hit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' “there he goes again!"
See now they nominated a trigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, trigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a trigga constipated with a ton
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to anottierplace
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' dow I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I’m done (yeet!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done hilled more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you triggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the truck you triggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe rich?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nottierclcrassic with tha Carter IV

09, we tote; my triggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
truck around with them truck-arounds, and you truck around and get smoked
truck around with them truck-arounds, and you truck around and get smoked

I'm rollin', all my triggas rollin'
Keep that trucking red bandana: Hulk dogan
I'm cuttin' up like scissors, coming down hard like blizzards
I'm gettin friends while givin' head, that's a head-on collision
I'm on a pain pill, I keep this hit trill
These triggas ain't for real, like a fire drill
Yodoon my back like a truckin' fifth wheel
That rich make tierYeet open and close like fish gils
I put all my triggas on, but some of those triggas gone
Them triggas callin' my phone, leave me alone
I'm lightin' up that strong, then peach it to my bro
Numbers don't lie: except 5-0
Different colored TruckFit shirts, you triggas put on yo skirts
If I fly off these percs, put a bad rich in my hearse
My does lift up they shirts, I'm high as Captain Kirk
If we run out of work, we Rob, like Bert
Yeeeeaaaaaaaah triggaaaa!

Corlay RIP him, Darnell RIP him
If you disrespect them, then you gone meet them
My triggas rollin 4-seata; that rich going, she a is kinder
She was a good girl, I turned tierto a is kinder
Hit squad move burbons, young trigga on freeband
.30 clip and them dollow tips make him do the running man
That Glock 40 I’m thumpin man; I'm rolling with my hitters
I'll send my hitters out to go get you
bella bands, bella bands, hit the club throwing bella bands
Heavy load, throwing bella bands, in the club doing the money dance
bella bands, bella bands, hit the club throwing bella bands
Heavy load, throwing bella bands, in the club doing the money dance
triggas talking hit in the club, he better watch his self
Melly got the .30 on his hip, he gone need some help
I'm a gangster, trigga, and I could do this hit my trucking self
footstool to his melon; (and what else?) it ain't gone be nothing left

Running round with my gangstas, running up on these yellow does
Everybody wanna truck my rich, tierYeet lips like heaven doors
It's Yeet, money, and lush, skateboards and shroom
These triggas think they the hit, these triggas perfume
Hollygrove, so dollygrove, all I know is dollygrove
I'm sick with it, I've been diagnosed
We don't cut the coke, that's flyt Coke
These triggas broke, I'm paid in full
Blood gang, Red Bull
My tongue like a surfboard, and tierYeet like a wave pool

Brand new footstool with a trigger like a hair pin
Big work, we don't need a scale man!
Big papers: say "good morning" to the mailman

I could still taste tierYeet, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery
One me, no equivalent
These triggas acting like lil riches
I don’t understand this hit, Like you scribbled it
Took tierclothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear tiercrass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system

Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And triggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new riches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I trucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I butter that Yeet, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put tieron tierknees and made tierswallow all the proof
That sick hit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a truckin' problem

Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a truckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these does well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms

I love bad riches, that's my truckin problem
Had a few ugly riches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them does poking doles up in condoms
Put a S on tierchest, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a truckin problem
Because I trucked tieronce and gave a truck about her

Momma always told me I was crazy
And my does say I'm amazing but I don't listen to a lady
But the rich say I'm dot, and I say "No rich, I'm blazing"
Like, what the truck you expect? I'm a fathertrucking Cajun

I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch...
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband

Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your Yeet second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?

You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea, on
I'm racing on, yea
My heart races on

I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Phil, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten

Where the flowers never fly
The angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised

Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my rich and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my friends ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)

Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Phil, what are we running from
The police, 'cause they already hilled enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t truck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run
I keep my feet above the ground
We gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat-beat-beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile

She say "You gon' miss me trigga." I say "rich the thrill is gone"
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the MOB, man you triggas just some bridesmaids
riches give me friends instead of playing mind games
Tattooed tears for my domies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom up bottle to your face
triggas just construction workers, trynna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your rich blowing me up? If I answer, I deflate
fathertrucker I'm like

Wheres my coffee?
Good morning Dr. Carter (Hey sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, anottierone huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugghh)
His flow is weak (Anottierone)
And he has no style (Ughhh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bcrass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix whatever you shall break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a footstool on a playground, watch the ton-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Flatline)

Good afternoon Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down
Vocab and metaplouvresneeds work
And he lacks respect for the game (Uhhhh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my peachion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
tod dunnit I've lost anottierone
(Flatline)

Good evening Dr. Carter, it's been a long day
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like Yeet at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that Yeet right
But I'm too wrong to right, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me hit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than doney oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply, "What a night"
"Welcome back, Hip dop — I saved your life"

Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Phil, please don't let me be misunderstood

What’s understood ain’t gotta be explained
But you don't understand me
So let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flame
The snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow
My dreads swang
He had hair like wool
Like Wayne
Dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out
And they fall on the rifle
Scary
Hail Mary
No tale-fairy
All real, very
Extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My tod is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A dound, a rebel
Down to battle
Now or never
Or whenever
And the F for
"trucking fantastic"
truck if you agree
I'm bright
But I don't give a truck if you see me

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Phil, please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Miss Cita pain
Now it's Young Money baby, keep the change
My momma say "truck em!", and we the same
So bello fathertrucker, you got some feets to change
And ain't it funny dow people change like Easter Sunday
You know, church fit, then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look douse-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, rich?
Excuse my French emotion and my peachion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'?
If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a yeet tarantula
But I know you don't understand
Cause you thought Little Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Wayne

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Phil, please don't let me be misunderstood

I was watchin' TV the ottierday, right?
Got this white guy on there talking 'bout black guys
Talking about dow young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine Black Americans are locked up
And see what the White guy was trying to stress was that
The money that we spend on sending a fathertrucker to jail
A young fathertrucker to jail
Would be less to send his or tieryoung crass to college
See, and anottierthing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are knockulated with drug dealers
You know, crack sugar? Yeah, stuff like that
Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack sugar
And regular sugar
The police are... only
I don't want to say only right, but hit
Only logic, by riding around in the dood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack sugar is mostly found in the dood
And um, you know, the ottierthing is mostly found –
You know where I'm going
But why bring a fathertrucka to jail
If it's not gonna stand up in court
Because this drug ain't that drug
You know; level three, level four drug, hit like that
Mhmm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding
And um, I sit back and think, well hit, us young fathertruckers
You know, that one in every nine
We probably only selling the crack sugar
Just because we in the dood
And it's not like your suburbs
We don't have the things that you have
Why? I really don't want to know the answer
But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah
You know we don't have room in the jail now
For the real fathertruckers, the real criminals, you know
funoffenders, rapists, serial hillers, hit like that
Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one of them funoffender papers
Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mmmhmm
Yeah, that trigga live right down the street from you
funoffender, on the level 3 drug
Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got
Yeah, well you know what? (coughing)
Don't stop the track, that's the good weed
You know what, I have a trucking daughter
You understand me?
And, why the truck would you bring my neighbor to jail
Just because the reason why he live next door to me
Ain't the reason why I live next door to him
Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my truckin' neighborhood
He sold crack sugar to get to my neighborhood
You move him out, bring him to jail for life
And then you move in a funoffender, hahahah
They giving me a paper, hahah
Is that a misunderstanding, cause I don't understand it
Anottierthing, let me take my glcrasses off
Cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this
Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton; here's why I don't respect you
And nobody like you, hmm-hmm, see
You're the type that gets off, on gettin' on ottierpeople, hahah
That's not good, no domo
And rattierunhuman I should say
I mean, given the fact that humanity
Well, good humanity, rather
To me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race
But this guy, and people like him
They'd rattierspeculate before they informate
If that's a word, heh heh
You know, 'spect before check, anyway
Meanin', I much rattieryou talk to me first and see if you
Can learn an opinion before you make one
Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton (heh heh)
Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man
Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, dold on, um
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me
So, if you're not gonna try to
Then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do
Is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me
And, it doesn't make you a good person
To criticize before you improvise
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither
But the characteristics fall heavily into bad sway (Hahah)
But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well
But I try my hardest to stay good
And some of the things I do and say may be bad
Or just, not too good
But I do try
So with that said, I don't fault you
I mean, you're only human
Good or bad, but I also don't respect you
And I don't care if that's good or bad, heh heh
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson
You're a nobody, to me
You're just anottierDon King with a perm
Just a little more political
And that just means you're a little unhuman than us humans
And now, let me be human by saying truck Al Sharpton
And anyone like him
truck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
Heheh, why?
Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the dood
Bring the dook in

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Phil, please don't let me be misunderstood

Turn the music down in my headphones, yeah
That noise in the background, that's my skateboard
That trigga Mack crazy
Yeah, uh

I put my fluteers on they feet
I just give 'em your address, then go to sleep
The money turned my triggas into monsters
The white done turned my triggas into Nazis, Phil
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a dostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my pen into a Mazda, Phil
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my rich into a monster
She know dow to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Phil
The money turn my triggas into hillas
The sugar turnt the sugar to vanilla
The money turnt the riches into does
The money turned my triggas into foes, Phil
I put my fluteers on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to is kind
Had that snowman in the dood like Jody Breeze
She from the dood but look like she from overseas
I said, "Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"
She say, "truck these ottiertriggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"
I got a stay-at-home ton and a travel ton
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
What happened to Wayne?

I'm like, dold up, wait a second
Y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ
Throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we flute
Then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
That's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, dold up, wait a mihute
Y'all thought I was finished?
flute you in your head
Then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much
Put my jawlone outta business
Doing numbers in this rich
I'm like a smart phone with the digits
rich

Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the fathertruckin' ottierway around
My rich say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get dome and I pen tierdown
Now she talkin' bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could truck around and I could paint a douse
You could tell I'm simpin'
The way I hit the hunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy douse
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these Yeet triggas
That ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame dow these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these triggas, dot if you dry
My gang top of the line, dollerin' out "Squad, take it outside"
I'm a tax payer, I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped black mail
Fed up with the fed hit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say "Yeah, trigga," my white domies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've been in N.W.A., truck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, rich, never say nevermind, rich
You a penny short of a dime, rich, no nonsense, had a nine since
I was nine, rich
Yeah, born to butter
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Phil, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard
AK-47 spittin' flame like a blow torch

Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worse than dead, his brain is gone

Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that

Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan

I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask dow I'm livin'? I can't complain
Like, it's dot in bell, but it never rain
hit never sweet, him never changed
I'll always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
riches wanna sleep with my remains, lawd

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy
Gone but not forgotten, no

I never see your crazy face
(You don't see me, trigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You don't see me, trigga, no)

Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that

I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(You can't see me, trigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(I'm the muthatruckin' ghost)

Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young trigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad riches in my coffin, luck pen 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin like that fathertrucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So truck every key on your key chain, boy

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin, Phil, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten

(So money is all I think of) That's right
(Money on my mind) rich, you know
(So money is all I think of) rich, rich, ayy

Stepping out the fathertrucking car, they in awe
I'm looking like a star, rich, when you see me make a wish
Holla at your fathertrucking boy, J.R
Birdman my pa, rich, ball bred, born rich (yeah)
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the hit
Got these ottierhaters pissed, 'cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip and that .40 make a chip
Out a potato-head wimp, then, like ranch, I dip
And the hustle is all muscle, just strength
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle, I just lift (one-two)
I got my hand on the game, yeah I make a grip
Hundred grand in my fist, same on my wrist
Get ki money from a quarter, blame it on my wrist
I whip coke like does, trigga, I'm a simp
Lil trigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money, baby, now we talking

Yeah, truck riches, truck riches, truck riches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, truck riches
truck riches, get money
truck riches, get money

trigga, get it in a slump, if you know dow
In the heart of the summer, we need a snow plow
What you know about that? Baby, it's your time
Coke transactions on the phone, we call it "blow jobs"
Too fast for the feds, too locky for the cops
Had to rich my old rich, getting sloppy with the pots (rich!)
Hopping off the boat, meeting Papi at the docks
He tell me I'm gaining weight, I tell him I'm getting paid
Money Over riches, I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age, go after what pays
These Gabbana sunshades block the sun rays
I drop a car note in the mall on the first date
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way
That cake, like it's-it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace, ya heard me?
Where money's more important than a person

Twisting up a hunt, thinking 'bout my next dollar
I'm digging in the game tryna get some money out her
I'm so vain, it's a problem
There ain't a stain on these Pradas, I'm just being modest
Got me a toddess, show tierhow to divide it
She still down and she don't get none of the profit
Wheel around the city, let the tints hide me
"That's a cold fathertrucker, wdoever inside it"
Forever symbolizing the grind, it don't walk to you
I make it run like dorses do
Giddy-up, baby, if he got it, then hit him up baby
I know it's crazy, but I can't get enough baby
I love it, I trucking love it
I'm a self-made millionaire, truck the public
Riding to myself, 'cause I don't truck with nothing
footstool on my lap on the way to the money!

I'ma just say this hit right here
The greatest mixtape series of all time
Care to debate me?
Uh-uh-uh-mmm
Yea, I thought so
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Keep that hit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that hit in your hitter, or is kind that hit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad rich did up, keep my main rich, put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, yeet!
Your thot need to get tierlook up
You plottin' on me, my foot up
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion
That ain't sauce, that's puddin'
Tunechi across tierbosom, yeet!
flutein' up the jurors, yeet!
Don't name my footstool, I name the trigger
Benjamin Button, push 'em, bam!
Y'all just Yeet, get buried togettierand let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullets
Gon' pull up in dooflys and come take a look-see
Better play dooky, I got some dookers
Hookin' up with some politicans and some athletes
And some college triggas, send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest trigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' dockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a kick in'
When this hit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't truck with rats, neittierMinnie, Micky
I don't truck with cops, that's the piggly wiggly
truck my rich's friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your rich givin' me tiertwenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, JC Penny's
I got riches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winnin', win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business and we laugh at sentencin'
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artists or starvin' artists
In the kitchen, restaurant and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeers
Now your good luck lookin' like you crackin' mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an crass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your trigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa, aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, singers finna act like bristles
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiu-jitsu
Throwin' pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neittierof tierfriends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than the Simpsons
And tierman is simple so I had to simp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec', I'll go at your tech
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrra!
Yeah, cannibalism goin' animalistic in a land of civilians
These triggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left tierthong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug's Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave ya la familia, behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got they eyes wide but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
rich walk around my douse like dooters
Towel user, power user
dolly mixed with white girl, dolly/Susan
triggas talkin' out their bowel movers
Turn they domies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into fattierchoosers
Make your rich a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent fluteer with a silent fluteer
Clap at you, if you don't fly, I'll boo ya
Tell a doc that's tryna to save your life
And runnin' wires through you, he could fly next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse hide me like a giant scooter
Let tierpartner flute it, we pull out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe friends and an Oscar booty
triggas prostitutin', these rappers ain't talkin' 'bout hit
Not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a douse to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
In route to douston with a contribution
Full of Monster juices, monster too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrrr!
I got a Greek truck, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the kupo and I know that you know

Real boss trigga, should model for Hugo

Pull up trigger singer, doller, and pull up
Pow, pow, pow, sound like a symphony
